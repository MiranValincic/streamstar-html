                  Data gathered by our servers: To ensure operational efficiency
                  and maintain service quality, we monitor your utilization of
                  our information and services, including how you utilize them
                  when applicable.
                </li>
                <li>
                  As an illustration, we maintain records of service traffic
                  patterns and retain user access details, such as IP addresses,
                  mobile device specifications, operating systems, browsers, and
                  more, in on-site log files. Our company's servers autonomously
                  collect specific non-identifiable data, such as the pages
                  visited by each user and the domain names of our visitors.
                  This information serves various purposes, including internal
                  assessments, traffic analysis, and customization of content
                  for individual visitors. Additionally, we may aggregate this
                  non-identifiable information into statistical reports, which
                  may be shared with third parties for marketing, advertising,
                  or research purposes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Kindly be aware that either we or third parties might gather
                  Personal Information regarding your online activities across
                  various devices and online attributes while utilizing the
                  Services.
                </li>
                <li>

                  Use of cookies: Every user visiting the website might receive
                  a single cookie. A cookie is a small file that websites write
                  to the hard disk drive of your computer when you visit them. A
                  cookie file can contain information such as the ID that the
                  site uses to track the pages you've visited. A cookie cannot
                  read data from the hard disk drive of your computer or read
                  cookie files created by other sites. We use cookies to keep an
                  account of the traffic patterns of users. When you register,
                  we use a cookie to store a unique ID. We use this ID to
                  anonymously identify you in our database and to track the
                  pages that you visit on the service, determine initial usage
                  versus repeat usage, and help target advertisements based on
                  user interests. Cookies can also help us make adjustments to
                  fit your interests and preferences. Some of our business
                  partners may use cookies on the service (for example,
                  advertisers). However, we have no access or control over these
                  cookies. If you have installed your browser so that you
                  receive a warning before accepting cookies, you will receive a
                  warning for each cookie. You may refuse cookies in your
                  browser leaving them inactive. However, The Company requires
                  cookies for access.

              <h2>4. Parental consent</h2>
              <p>
                Protecting the privacy of children is especially important. For
                that reason, the Company does not knowingly collect or solicit
                personal information from anyone under the age of 18. If you are
                under 18, please do not send any personal information, including
                your name, address, telephone, or e-mail address. It is not
                allowed for anyone under the age of 18 to provide any personal
                information to the Company. In the event that we learn that we
                have the personal information of someone under 18 without
                parental consent, we will terminate the account and delete all
                the personal information as quickly as possible. If you believe
                that we might have any information from anyone under 18, please
                contact Customer Support: support@streamstar.co .
              </p>

              <h2>5. Link to other sites</h2>
              <p>
                We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites
                linked to our website/service or the information or contents
                contained therein. Please remember that when you use a link to
                go from the service to another website, our Privacy Policy is no
                longer valid. Your browsing on any other website, including
                those linked to the service is subject to that website's own
                rules and policies. Please read their rules and policies before
                proceeding.
              </p>

              <h2>6. Notifications/Copyright</h2>
              <p>
                The Company places a high value on respecting third-party
                copyrights, and we have established a policy to respond to all
                copyright infringement notifications in accordance with relevant
                regulations. Upon receiving a notification that adheres to these
                guidelines, The Company may take action, including but not
                limited to removing or disabling access to the content believed
                to be infringing. In some cases, this may also involve disabling
                a user's account. During these actions, The Company will make
                efforts to reach out to the party responsible for posting the
                content, providing them with an opportunity to make any
                statements they deem necessary in accordance with applicable
                regulations.
              </p>

              <h2>7.Advertising</h2>
              <p>
                We use third parties such as network advertisers to serve
                advertisements on our site and email newsletters. Network
                advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based
                on your visits to our Site and other websites you have visited.
                This arrangement allows us, as well as these third parties, to
                tailor advertisements to your interests in products and
                services. Third-party ad network providers, advertisers,
                sponsors, and traffic measurement services may utilize
                technologies such as cookies, JavaScript, web beacons, Flash
                LSOs, and other tools to gauge the effectiveness of their
                advertisements and customize advertising content for you. It's
                important to note that these third-party cookies and other
                technologies are subject to the specific privacy policies of
                each third party, not the one presented here. We may provide
                these third-party advertisers with aggregated information about
                your usage of our website and services.
              </p>

                there may be instances where customers wish to request a refund
                for a purchase made via credit card payment on our website. The
                approval of refunds for credit card payments is solely at the

                team at support@streamstar.co . We will diligently assess your
                request and promptly communicate the results of our review to
                you. If your refund request is deemed valid, we will credit the
                full purchase amount to your credit card account, after
                deducting any relevant fees or charges. Please take note that
                refunds will exclusively be credited to the credit card used
                during the initial purchase. Moreover, refunds will only be
                granted to the original purchaser of the product, and no third
                parties, including spouses, relatives, partners, etc., are
                eligible to request refunds on behalf of the purchaser or under
                their own account.
