              <p>
                TopTap by Baseplay Limited, (referred to hereafter as the
                "Company", "we, "us", and/or "our") provides this Privacy Policy
                to describe how we collect, use, and share the information of
                individuals who visit our website toptap.co (hereafter referred
                to as the “website”). This policy further describes how we
                utilise any related services.
              </p>

              <p>
                The Company knows that you care about how your information may
                be used or shared and we are committed to ensuring it is kept
                secure and used carefully and within the confines of the law.
              </p>

              <p>
                Below you will find a summary of how and why we collect and use
                your data, who we share it with, and what we are doing to make
                sure your data is safe and secure.
              </p>

              <h2>Use and Treatment of Information</h2>

              <p>
                The Company informs the user that any information resulting from
                visiting its website or contracting its Products and Services
                will result in related personal data being included in an
                automated File duly registered in the General Register of the
                Data Protection as part of its automated processing system. For
                this end, you as the user express consent to such treatment.
              </p>

              <p>
                The Company may use aggregated personal information
                (non-identifiable) to improve and adapt the service to the needs
                of the user. This statistical compilation of non-identifiable
                information may be used or provided to others for marketing
                purposes, advertising and research. The main goal of the Company
                in collecting personal information is to provide you, the user,
                with the most personalized experience possible. Information
                collected about you enables us to deliver content and
                advertising more relevant to you, and in turn a better service.
                Only the Company has access to the individual accounts. The
                Company may also do research on demographics, interests and
                behavior based on the information you provided during the
                registration process, on order forms, during a promotion, as
                well as information from our server log files or surveys. We do
                this to better understand and serve our users. This research is
                compiled and analyzed in aggregate bases and the Company may
                share this aggregated data with advertisers, researchers and
                other businesses. From time to time, the Company may use your
                personal information to send you information about our products
                and services or other products and services that may be of
                interest to you. You can unsubscribe from this mailing list by
                emailing support@toptap.co with the word "UNSUBSCRIBE" in the
                subject. The Company is the sole owner of information collected
                on the service. We will not sell, share or rent this information
                to others in any way that varies from what we specified in this
                statement. The Company maintains appropriate safeguards to
                insure the security, integrity and privacy of personally
                identifiable information in its possession. However, as
                effective as these measures may be, no security system is
                impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database,
                nor can we guarantee that the information you provide will not
                be intercepted while being transmitted to us through the
                Internet.

              <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

              <p>
                Information collected by the servers: For operational purposes
                and quality assurance, we take note of whether you use and,
                where appropriate, how you use the information and services we
                provide. For example, we record the service traffic patterns and
                store user access information, such as IP address, mobile device
                information, OS, browser, etc, on site files (logs). The
                Company’s servers automatically collect certain non-personal
                information, such as which pages each user visits and the domain
                name of the visitors. We use this information for various
                purposes including internal review, traffic evaluation or
                adjusting information to individual visitors. A statistical
                compilation of this non-personal information may also be used
                and provided to others for marketing purposes, advertising or
                research.

                visit on the service, to determine initial usage versus repeat
                usage and to help target advertisements based on user interests.
                Cookies can also help us make adjustments to fit your interests
                and preferences. Some of our business partners may use cookies
                on the service (for example, advertisers). However, we have no
                access or control over these cookies. If you have installed your
                browser so that you receive a warning before accepting cookies,
                you will receive a warning for each cookie. You may refuse
                cookies in your browser leaving them inactive. However, The
                Company requires cookies for access.

                Personal information required by the Company in order to
                understand you and your needs: We primarily know you through the
                information you provide when you register to access the service.
                The Company requests that you provide personal information to
                enhance your experience on the service. During the registration
                process, the Company asks for your name, email address, your
                city and country. The more accurate the information you provide,
                the better we can design the service for your experience. We may
                also request other information, at other times, such as when you
                enter a contest or participate in a promotion or when ordering
                services from The Company. You can correct or change information
                in your profile. You can change this information at any time and
                as often as deemed necessary.
